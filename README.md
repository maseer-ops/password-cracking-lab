# Password Cracking Lab

This repository contains my project focused on password cracking. It includes a lab setup where various password hashes are cracked using different techniques. The project uses John the Ripper to crack hashes and utilizes wordlists such as the famous "rockyou.txt."

## Files
- `hashes.txt`: Contains the password hashes to be cracked.
- `wordlists/`: A folder containing wordlist files used for password cracking.
- `screenshots/`: Folder to store screenshots from the project demonstrating progress.
Here are some screenshots showing the progress and results of the project:
